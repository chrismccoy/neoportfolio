# NeoPortfolio: A WordPress Theme for Projects

## 💡 Overview

NeoPortfolio is a WordPress theme for showcasing projects and creative work with a bold, neo-brutalist design. It completely reimagines the content creation by replacing the WordPress editor for posts with a meta box interface. This allows users to manage all project specific data, from descriptions and feature lists to visual assets and external links. The frontend delivers a striking, high-contrast design.

## ✨ Features

Here's a comprehensive list of the functionalities and design elements that NeoPortfolio brings to your WordPress site:

*   **📝 Custom Meta Box Interface**: All project content (intro text, gallery, links, features) is managed through a meta box on the post edit screen.
*   **📣 Dynamic Intro Block**: Easily add a concise yet compelling introductory text that appears on the single project page in a stylized "info block."
*   **🖼️ Visual Assets Gallery**:
    *   **➕ Seamless Media Integration**: Upload and select multiple images using the native WordPress Media Uploader.
    *   **↔️ Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Effortlessly reorder your gallery images directly within the meta box using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
    *   **🗑️ Instant Image Removal**: Quickly remove individual images from the gallery preview.
    *   **👁️ Integrated Lightbox**: Provides a full- screen viewing for your project images.
*   **🔗 Comprehensive Project Links**:

    *   **😀 Emoji Picker**: Choose expressive emoji icons for each feature using a user friendly, lazy loaded emoji picker.
    *   **✅ Custom Delete Confirmation**: Replaces the standard browser `confirm()` dialog with a themed, modal popup for deleting feature rows.
*   **😁 Lazy-Loaded Emoji Picker**: Integrates an emoji selection tool (`EmojiMart`) that only loads its resources when the user actively triggers it, optimizing performance.
*   **🎨 Neo-Brutalist Frontend Design**: A striking, high-contrast, and bold design applied across all project display elements.
*   **📄 Dynamic Content Display**:
    *   **💬 Stylized Intro Block**: Your introductory text is presented in a distinct, attention-grabbing block.

*   **🏷️ Categorization & Tagging**:
    *   **📂 Category Badges**: Display assigned project categories with a clear folder icon and distinct neo-brutalist badge styling.
    *   **# Tag Badges**: Show project tags with a hashtag icon and complementary badge design.
*   **🔢 Custom Pagination**: Provides stylized "Previous" and "Next" navigation for archive pages for the themes design.
*   **🧹 Streamlined Admin UI**: The default WordPress editor is removed for the `post` type, creating a cleaner and more focused backend experience centered around the custom meta box.

## 🛠️ Usage

Once activated, create a new post or edit an existing one:

*   **Project Data & Visuals Meta Box**: This is your central hub for all project content.
    *   **Intro Block**: Enter a brief introduction in the textarea.
    *   **Project Details (Links)**: Provide URLs for "Live Project Link", "Purchase Link", and "Video URL." These will appear as styled buttons on the frontend.
    *   **Visual Assets Gallery**: Click "Select / Manage Images" to add media. Drag items to reorder them, and click the "×" to remove.
    *   **Feature List Items**: Click "+ Add New Feature Row". For each row, fill in the "Emoji Icon" (use the 😀 button to open the picker), "Feature Title", and "Description". Drag the row headers to reorder features.
*   **Categories and Tags**: Use the standard WordPress "Categories" and "Tags" meta boxes on the right sidebar. These will be automatically styled and displayed on the frontend.
